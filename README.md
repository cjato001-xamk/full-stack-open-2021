## About

The "Full Stack Open 2021"-course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs and also covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.
